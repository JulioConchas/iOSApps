# I Am Rick
this is my firt iOS app, as a project for learning from iOS & Switf Udemy Couse

I Am Rick is a reference app from an Historical iPhone app from 2008
which had a minimal function and was priced at US$999.99, The app was pulled from
the App Store less than 24 hours after its launch.
Receiving poor reviews from critics, only eight copies were sold. In the years
since, several similar application have been released at lower prices.

For this app I leaded an overal review of xCode Interface, how to create a iOS project
- Use of Labels
- Use of Image View
- How to import Assets

Finaly this small project was useful to learn how to simulate the app in a virtual iPhone
and also how to run in using a phisical devise for testing
